# tw2lint
Basic code linter for TW2 files

The idea for this is that I'm working on large TW2 files (Twine games).

It's hard to keep consistency around the files, so I'm working on making something that will spot problems with the file, such as nodes that can't be reached or exited from, nodes where there are formatting errors, and so on.
